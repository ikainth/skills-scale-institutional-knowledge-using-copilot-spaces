# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Docs. This folder centralizes the project processes, templates, and role guidance teams need to initiate, plan, execute, release, and improve work consistently. These documents are intended to live alongside code and be used as the single source of truth for how we run cross‑functional projects.

Overview

OctoAcme follows an outcome‑driven, iterative lifecycle: projects begin with a concise Project One‑pager that defines the problem, SMART objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high‑level timeline. Approved initiatives move into planning where work is broken into shippable increments, acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done are defined, and a prioritized backlog and release plan are created. Day‑to‑day execution uses a predictable rhythm (daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, sprint demos) and a project board workflow (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done). Roles are explicit—Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA/testing, and Stakeholders—and responsibilities and decision logs are captured in project artifacts.

Quality is enforced through CI (tests, lint, security scans), automated unit/integration tests, end‑to‑end smoke tests for critical flows, and manual QA where acceptance criteria require it. Blocker escalation follows a three‑level path (team triage → PM escalation → sponsor escalation) and risks and dependencies are tracked in a Risk Register. Retrospectives capture learnings and action items to drive continuous improvement.

Purpose of this Copilot Space

- Centralize scattered project management knowledge in Copilot Spaces
- Convert tacit team insights into searchable, versioned artifacts
- Give all team members equal access to processes, decisions, and rationale
- Connect a repository as a structured knowledge source
- Extract, refine, and standardize workflows collaboratively
- Feed validated improvements back into living documentation
- Accelerate onboarding and reduce single‑person dependency risk
- Enable consistent, repeatable project execution

Program process documents live in `docs/` and issue templates are stored in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
